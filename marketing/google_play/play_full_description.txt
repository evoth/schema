A clean, customizable, and functional notes app with support for note organization, offline use, and real-time syncing across multiple devices.

Organize notes:
Using labels, each note can belong to multiple categories. Then, filter notes by a label to see the notes in that category.

Arrange notes:
Simply long press and drag a note to move it wherever you want. New notes are added at the top for easy access.

Real-time sync:
Keeping notes updated across devices is a breeze with automatic sync across all platforms when you sign in with your Google account.

Edit notes offline:
Never worry about internet connection; keep on editing offline, and your notes will sync once connection is restored.

Customizable theme:
With 18 color schemes and 3 brightness modes to choose from, have fun finding your favorite theme.
