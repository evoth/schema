A simple notes app with ability to access notes across separate devices.

## Todo

- Make it so you can't go back to loading screen
- Make public variables that should be private private
- Finishing touches
   - Theme
   - Note shapes
   - Tutorial / about
   - Smaller note edit window on bugger screens
   - Publish (web and possibly Google Play, not sure if worth $25 though)
