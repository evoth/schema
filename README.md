# Schema

## Plan

An all-in-one customizable approach to managing notes, tasks, events, and more.

## Current State

An extremely simple notes app with the very beginnings of responsive design. And in this version I haven't added data storage or a delete button.

## Usage Instructions

Web/Desktop
- Press the plus button to add a blank note. Click notes to edit them. Drag notes to arrange them.

Mobile
- Press the plus button to add a blank note. Tap notes to edit them. Press and hold on the edge of notes then drag to arrange them.

## Todo

- Use Widget.of(context).function() instead of callbacks?
- Eliminate hard-coded values and gather them in one place as constants
- **Make public variables that should be private private**
- Fix codestyle
- **Stateful vs Stateless**
